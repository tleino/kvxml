xmlq
====

xmlq is a simple command-line tool for converting XML files to a simple
key-value format, so that XML content can be easily processed with
standard line-based Unix text-processing tools such as grep, sed, awk.

Dependencies
============

A standard Unix-like base system with C compiler, development headers
installed and pkg-config, plus:

- libexpat (e.g. libexpat1-dev)

Build & Install
===============

./configure ~
make install

Usage
=====

e.g.

./xmlq -s <file.xml | grep /html/body/name

Example
=======

examples/slashdot.sh is a proof of concept showing xmlq can be used
to quickly write an RSS reader by combining standard line-based
text-processing tools. It uses curl for getting the feed, xmlq and
awk for parsing it, and lynx and nroff for formatting the output.

Without arguments, it gives the list of articles, formatted with nroff.
With a number argument, it gives the article, formatted with lynx.
